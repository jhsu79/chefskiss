2. Add a Show Page and implement a feature to allow users to add their impressions of a restaurant.  
3. Caching search results to avoid unnecessary fetch calls from the API.  
4. Restrict a user from saving restaurants in their list more than once. 
5. Implement Auth0 Authorization. 
6. Implement a Restaurant view that allows users to view all other users' impressions. 
7. Implement the use of an OpenAI API that aggregates and summarizes all users' impressions.  
8. Cloudinary support that allows users to upload images of the food or experience.
